Welcome to My Printf
Task
The task is to implement the my_printf() function in C, which will produce output according to a format string provided as input. The function should write output to the standard output stream, stdout. The function should handle a range of conversion specifications and output the corresponding values.

Description
The my_printf() function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments. The format string specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. The format string consists of zero or more directives, which are either ordinary characters (not %), or conversion specifications. A conversion specification begins with the % character, followed by one or more of the following flags:

Installation
