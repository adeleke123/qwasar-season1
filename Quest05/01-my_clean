find . -type f \( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \) -print -delete
: '
Explanation:

find .: search for files in the current directory (.) and its subdirectories.
-type f: only search for regular files, not directories.
-name '*~' -o -name '#*#': search for files with names ending in ~ or starting and ending with #. The -o flag means "or", so this will match either of those conditions.
-print: print the names of the files found.
-delete: delete the files found.
