## Quest05
Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!

We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file

For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit directory` and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit file(s)`

## Introduction
Letâ€™s go back and do some shell.

The objective is to be more of an expert with find and discover -type file option, globing (* replace any characters...), and --exec to be able to run another command (for example basename :D.)

Finally, pipe (|) lets you chain commands.

| Quest05	| My Count Files |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Submit directory	| ex00 |
| Submit file |	my_count_files |

## Description
Exercise: my_count_files

Write a command line that counts and displays the number of regular files and directories in the current directory and all its sub-directories. It should include ".", the starting directory.

Example 00
Example of output:

$>./my_count_files | cat -e
13$
$>
Tips
You should dig into the command ls (man ls)
You should dig into the command wc (man wc)

Quest05	My Clean
Submit directory	ex01
Submit file	my_clean
Description
In a file called my_clean place the command line that will search for all files - in the current directory as well as in its sub-directories - with a name ending by ~, or a name that start and end by #

The command line will print and delete all files found.
Only one command is allowed: no ; or && or other gitaneries.

Example 00

$>my_clean
./.zshrc~
...
./blah/#tat#
$>
Tip
You should dig into the command find (man find)

Quest05	My Find Sh
Submit directory	ex02
Submit file	my_find_sh
Description
Write a command line that searches for all file names that end with ".sh" (without quotation marks) in the current directory and all its sub-directories. It should display only the name of files without the extension .sh.

Example 00

$>./my_find_sh | cat -e
file1$
file2$
file3$
$>
Tips
You should dig into the command find (man find) specially the -exec option
You should dig into the command basename
You should dig into the command rev (man rev)
You should dig into the command cut (man cut)
You should dig into the command sed (man sed)

Quest05	My Patch
Submit directory	ex03
Submit file	my_patch
Description
Patch transform a file origin to a fixed file applying the transformation or you can called it patch.

Create a file my_patch, so that:

$>diff a my_patch > sw.diff
Use the patch command to apply the patch on file a from the diff sw.diff. :-)

$>cat a
